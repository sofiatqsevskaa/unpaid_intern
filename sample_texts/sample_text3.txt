Chloe Plants a Tree

Chloe visited Green Thumb Garden Center on Tuesday afternoon. She bought a Japanese maple sapling, acidic soil, and a blue terracotta pot. The total was $85.

The maple had red lacy leaves. An elderly worker named Martha gave Chloe planting instructions. Martha said the tree needs morning sun and good drainage.

Chloe lives in apartment 12B with a small balcony. She spent one hour planting the tree carefully. First she added pebbles for drainage, then soil, then the sapling.

The tree is now on her balcony where it gets morning sunlight. Chloe waters it every three days. She hopes it will grow tall and provide shade in future years.
