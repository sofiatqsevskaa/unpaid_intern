Michael Buys a Synthesizer

Michael visited Leo's Electronics Repair Shop on Main Street. The shop smelled like solder and old plastic. Leo sold him a refurbished 1980s synthesizer for $200.

The synthesizer had scratches and yellowed buttons. Leo said it was "temperamental" but Michael loved the warm bass sound it made. Leo also gave him a box of old patch cables for free.

Michael took the synthesizer to his garage studio. He spent three hours experimenting with different sounds. The analog machine created unexpected feedback and drones.

His digital equipment was precise and controlled. The old synthesizer added chaos and creativity. Michael posted a video of his new setup on Instagram that night.
