Sara's Saturday Market Trip

Sara went to the farmers market on Saturday morning. She bought fresh tomatoes, leafy greens, and local honey. The tomatoes were bright red and heavy. The greens had colorful stems.

At a pottery stand, she found a handmade mug. It had a small imperfection in the glaze, but she liked it anyway.

Sara paid $45 total. She walked home with a full basket. Later that day, she made tomato sauce with garlic. She used the honey in her tea, drinking from the new mug.

The market is at Central Park every Saturday from 8am to 2pm.
